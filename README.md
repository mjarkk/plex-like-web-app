# A plex like web app
## Goal
A site where you can view you images, movies and music on the 2017 way.
"2017 way" This means it needs to be stabele so if you are offline the data still loads,
all the animations are somooth,
auto changing resolution in movies depending on your network speed,
all api data is secure from end to end,
you can share everyting,
load a page before you have even clicked it
and it's of course mobile friendly
